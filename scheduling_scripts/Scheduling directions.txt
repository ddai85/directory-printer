Google App Engine requires the default service to be deployed at all times.

The directory app was split into two microservices-- default being a very simple shell that redirects to the directory.

A cronjob on another server is in charge of starting/stopping the directory service (which is named hinson).

The cronjob can be edited with the "startitup" script which sets up all the cronjobs. Use this command to start it:

"sudo ./startitup -u ec2-user -h /home/ec2-user" when on an AWS ec2 server.

Make sure the startHinson and sleepHinson script paths match what's in startitup. Also make sure the gcloud path is correct in the individual scripts.

Note that cron times are set in GMT, and very few environmental variables are carried into cron.
